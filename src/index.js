import Game from "./game.js";

// DOmContentLoaded -> initUI
// initUI
// Tell user to drag ships into game board and press button when ready to play
// Add Event listener to ready button

// Button press will trigger:
// const game = new Game();
// Init while loop - while (!)
// Players turn first - tell player to click square on opponents gameboard to take their turn
// Valid square click will trigger

// When win condition is met display winner
// Button/click to end game? - reset everything?

// Maybe seperate file for game controller logic? (still only backend though???
